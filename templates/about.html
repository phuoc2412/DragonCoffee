                <h2>The Birth of Dragon Coffee</h2>
                <p class="about-text">Founded in 2015, Dragon Coffee Shop began as a small kiosk in a bustling market. Our founders, Lin and Marco, shared a passion for quality coffee and a fascination with dragon mythology from cultures around the world.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Inspired by the dragon's symbolism of power, wisdom, and good fortune, they created a coffee shop that embodies these qualities in every cup served. What started as a humble stand has now grown into multiple locations, each carrying the fiery spirit of our original vision.</p>

                <h2>Our Coffee Philosophy</h2>
                <p class="about-text">At Dragon Coffee, we believe that exceptional coffee is both an art and a science. We source our beans directly from sustainable farms around the world, carefully selecting varieties that offer distinctive flavors and characteristics.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Our master roasters bring out the unique profile of each bean, creating signature blends that range from bold and intense to smooth and subtle—each named after legendary dragons from different mythologies.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Every cup is crafted with precision, whether it's a simple espresso or our famous "Dragon's Breath" latte with its signature spicy finish.</p>
